TicketMate - Public Transport E-Ticketing System (Level 2 Software Project - Mentored by Bistec Global)

The public transport-focused web application includes searching for trains and buses, reserving seats on trains and buses by making online card payments, changing reservations, canceling reservations with a refund, live vehicle tracking, emergency updates, scheduling trains and buses, registering vehicles and drivers, and vehicle income prediction. This addresses the challenges in Sri Lanka's public transportation system, using a user-friendly web application that enhances the reliability, convenience, and efficiency of commuting.

In this project, I have developed the functionalities for searching for trains and buses, reserving seats in trains and buses according to availability and user preference, changing and canceling reservations with refunds, and managing passenger profiles.
