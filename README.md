TicketMate - Public Transport E-Ticketing System (Level 2 Software Project - Mentored by Bistec Global)

The public transport-focused web application includes searching for trains and buses, reserving seats on trains and buses by making online payments, changing and canceling reservations with a refund, live tracking, emergency updates, registering vehicles and drivers, scheduling vehicles, and income prediction. This addresses the challenges in the public transportation system. In this project, I have developed the functionalities for searching for trains and buses, reserving seats, changing and canceling reservations, and managing passenger profiles
